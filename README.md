This is a small Labyrinth game with theming options (10x5 character tile for walls & paths).
The default tile set is loosely based on the backrooms.
Currently Linux only.

Building on Linux:
- build.sh will create the required directories and compile everything needed

Keyboard Repeat may help for quicker movement:
- Tested with a repeat delay of 300ms & repeat rate of 50ms

Suggested Values for Level Iterations/Size:
- 300 to 500 for small monitors (laptops) and short completion times
- 1000 to 5000 for longer completion times
- 3000 to 10000+ is fine on desktops (1920x1080)
- Anything up to 1000000 will generate quick enough
- Coordinates make higher values (e.g 10000000) more viable

autoPlayer:
- Faster placement times (can sample path created by autoGen)
- Automatically generates and switches to the next level (increments tile by one)
- Starts at and cycles back to 0
- The Level can be re-generated by pressing "R"
- Has a goal marked by a spiral

player:
- Slower placement times (if not present on map)
- Loads the current map in ../loadedLevel/map
- Uses the level number set in ../loadedLevel/level
- Has a goal same as autoPlayer but it disappeares on contact instead

genMap:
- Generates and writes a map to ../loadedLevel/map
