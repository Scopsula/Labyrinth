This is a small Labyrinth game with theming options (10x5 character tile for walls & paths).
The default tile set is loosely based on the backrooms.
Currently Linux only.

Building on Linux:
- build.sh will create the required directories and compile everything needed

Keyboard Repeat may help for quicker movement:
- Tested with a repeat delay of 300ms & repeat rate of 50ms

Suggested Values for Level Iterations/Size:
- 300 to 500 for small monitors (laptops) and short completion times
- 1000 to 3000 for longer completion times
- 3000 to 10000+ is fine on desktops (1920x1080)
- 10000 takes ~1.27 seconds to generate on my system
- 100000 takes ~129 seconds to generate on my system

autoPlayer:
- Automatically generates and switches to the next level (increments tile by one)
- Starts at and cycles back to 0
- The Level can be re-generated by pressing "R"
- Has a goal marked by a spiral

player:
- Loads the current map in ../loadedLevel/map
- Uses the level number set in ../loadedLevel/level
- Has no end goal currently

genMap:
- Writes the selected level number to ../loadedLevel/level
- Generates and writes a map to ../loadedLevel/map

genTiming:
- Used to benchmark the map generation times
- Does not modify the level number
- Generates and writes a map to ../loadedLevel/map

mapCollection:
- Place for storing maps of intesrest (e.g high iteration count)
