<p>
Labyrinth is a rougelike backrooms game <br>
with static procedurally generated levels that have <br>
some dynamic procedural generation (structures), <br>
which are currently placed deterministically <br>
based on coordinates, which generate when in range
</p>

<p>
The game includes items which can be picked up <br> 
across the levels, as well as 'chests' <br>
(in the form of crates) which contain <br>
limited random amounts of specific items.
