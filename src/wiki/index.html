<h2>Wiki Content</h2>

<p>
This wiki documents the various levels and <br>
entities in Labyrinth as well as technical details <br>
and mechanics
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Labyrinth is a rougelike backrooms game <br>
with static procedurally generated levels that have <br>
some dynamic procedural generation (structures), <br>
which are currently placed deterministically <br>
based on coordinates (these generate when in range)
</p>

<p>
The game includes items which can be picked up <br> 
across the levels, as well as 'chests' <br>
(in the form of crates) which contain <br>
limited random amounts of specific items
</p>

<p>
Entities move in real-time, however combat is <br>
turn based. Events during combat are determined  <br>
by player and entity stats, combat includes a <br>
de/buff system which allows for permenant, <br>
temporary, and repeated stat modification
</p>

<p>
The game does not yet include a level system, <br>
however one is planned to provide means to increase <br>
stats during a run and unlock more moves/skills in combat. <br>
Stats such as health and thirst can be restored by finding items <br>
which auto-use if needed, or otherwise can be used via the <br>
inventory
</p>

<p>
One survival mechanic is in place: thirst drain <br>
which, if left unaccounted for, results in rapid health <br>
decrease
