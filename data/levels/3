What is nV?
It stands for neat version.
nV, unlike other properties affects parts of the initial generation.
It's goal is to open up hard-coded, level-specific, features to provide
alternative (neater) types of generation.

How does it effect this level?
For level 3 the first attribute (bool) determines whether to neaten
up the corridors by limiting the length to two consistent values,
tY and tX. The second (int) determines the modifier for the chance of
the hardcoded 'halls' spawning. Setting this value to 0 disables them.
